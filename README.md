# Bellboy üí°‚òùÔ∏è

A binary for managing dotfiles cross-platform. Take your dotfiles wherever you
go!

Bellboy is a Git repository manager oriented towards cross-platform dotfiles.
It draws heavy inspiration from [`vcsh`], which focuses on managing local
repositories, and otherwise leaves the history of your dotfiles repository(ies)
to Git. Here's an example of Bellboy (the `bb` binary) in action:

```sh
# Start from scratch by adding some existing repos of yours. Since you probably
# have a normal Git repo or two lying around (which would be "standalone" repos
# in Bellboy terms), let's use those!
$ bb standalone register ./my-first-repo
$ bb standalone register ./my-second-repo

# üëÄ We can see that Bellboy registered these repos with a `list` subcommand:
$ bb list

# Run `git push` on each repo we've configured in Bellboy.
$ bb for-each -- git push
```

## Installation

For now, you may build Bellboy via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```sh
$ cargo install bellboy
```

Binary distributions in GitHub and your favorite package manager(s) are coming
soon (see also [the roadmap](#roadmap))!

## Credits

Much of the inspiration for this project's design of `overlay` repos is from
[`vcsh`], which you are encouraged to check out if you always use `bash` as
your shell, or always have it available in your command-line.
